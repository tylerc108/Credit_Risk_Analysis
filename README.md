# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

For this analysis, we analyzed the risk for a credit lender called LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to help them predict which loans would most likely turn out to be good loans and which would most likely turn out to be bad. We received a large data set containg information on loans that the company had previously given out and used this to create our model. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


Output for Naive Random Oversampling:

* The accuracy score was around .65, meaning approximately 65 predictions out of 100 were correct. 
* The precision was calculated to be .99, which is very high and means that 99% of predicted true outcomes were in fact true. 
* The sensitivity/recall was calculated .59, meaning 59% of . Because this model has high precision, the trade-off is that it has relatively low sensitivity.
